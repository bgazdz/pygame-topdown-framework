Information:
Rico-Ja was created by Robert Gazdziak and Thomas Lesniak for the Fall 2014 UIUC ACM GameBuilders
game buildathon. The game had to be top-down, no code could be created before the event started,
and the theme that was revealed at the start of the competition was YOLO (You Only Live Once).

This game was created and completed in the 12-hour time limit.

Helpful tips:

ALL BULLETS Ricochet

Enemies spawn offscreen and move on screen (beware being along the edges of the screen)

Enemies and bullets kill you by touching you once

Shovel wipes all enemies and bullets

Bullets don't disappear until they hit you or an enemy

Didn't have time to make enemy collisions, so enemie sprites can be under other enemy sprites
